I am currently doing my Ph.D. in Machine Learning (ML) under the supervision of [Jakob Macke](https://www.mackelab.org/people/) at the University of Tuebingen and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/) ). 
I am primarly interested in developing flexible and efficient methods for Bayesian inference and applying them to problems in science.

Currently I am focused on projects around *simulation-based inference* ([SBI](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1912789117)). 
Simulators are modern tools for testing scientific ideas. They mimic how (we think) things work in nature and how we measure them.
With computer programming and powerful computers, we can create very detailed simulations and generate synthetic data from them. These simulations are vital for predicting and understanding how things behave in science and engineering.

Yet, they form a challenging statistical inference for unobservable quantities. Methods from deep learning and generative modeling 
became popular for solving such inverse problems. However, they can be brittle to model misspecification or even tiny adversarial perturbations.
Furthermore they are often not flexible enough to capture the complexity of the simulator, but require a lot of data to train which is inherently limited for (slow!) scientific simulators.
These are some of the problems I am trying to solve with my research.

Here are some recent posts by me. You can also look them at in the Blog section or the archive. These are majorly about topics which I found sufficiently interesting to write about.
