I am currently doing my PhD in Machine Learning under the supervision of Jakob Macke at the University of Tuebingen. I am exited about ML: With the right data and the right analytics, people can choose a solid course of action not based on hunches or guesses but on actual evidence.
ML can blow through terabytes of experimental data, highlighting anomalies and detecting patterns humans could have never spotted.

We have always learned from oberservation, science is done based on observations. Science has also advanced through simulation. You've may notice the little simulation above. It is not a random stochastic process, it is one that evolves according to the Lotka Volterra model.
