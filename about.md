I am a PhD student at the University Tübingen and part of the International Max-Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS). I am supervised by Prof. Dr. Jakob Macke.

In my PhD I work on adversarial robustness and calibrated uncertainty in amortized Bayesian inference. Most of current literature focus on classification. Yet as large scale inference algorithms become more popular in scienctific or medical domains, this topic becomes increasingly relevant.


I am generally very interested in the field of probabilistc machine learning but also learning theory in general. If you want to know more about my interests or optinions you can checkout my posts (which essentially are topics I found sufficiently interesting to dive into it and writing an article (and found time to do so (: )).

# Some notes

If I read into interesting topics I typically as default write a small article about it together with a way simplified example (if it is a method). This is mostly what I will post here. I try to explain it from scratch and try to include (simple) proof (ideas) for any claims I raise, but I assume from the reader some basic knowledge about math and statistics.
